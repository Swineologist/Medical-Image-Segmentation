# Medical Image Processing 

There are 3 MATLAB Live Scripts which deals with different aspects of image segmentation. The data set is from the medical domain (cell images) but the workflow is fairly general and can be used in other fields also.
 
1. Ex\_1\_Cell\_segmentation\_part1.mlx deals with image segmentation based on colour information.
2. Ex\_2\_Cell\_segmentation\_part2.mlx deals with image segmentation based on *texture*.
3. Ex\_3\_Using\_simple\_parallel\_computing.mlx makes use of simple parallel computing commands to increase execution speed and also guides the user on how to use a compute cluster to off-load the code.
